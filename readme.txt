WARNING!
********
Moneytime is still in beta, so be aware that things might not work properly sometimes. Some problems we have identified so far:
- Autocomplete functions on certain websites might not work because of Moneytime. That does not occur every time, but Facebook is affected, for instance. Just turn the extension off in case you notice a problem like that.
- Some websites load the content dynamically AFTER the html structure is loaded. In those cases, Moneytime won’t be able to read and parse the page’s content.

We’re still working on that and we hope to solve these problems as soon as possible, so that everybody can enjoy a better digital life with Moneytime!
If you notice any there problem or have any suggestions on how to improve Moneytime, feel free to email us!

best wishes,
Gabriel and Gabor
